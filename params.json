{"name":"Gawk","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gawk.git","body":"  Copyright (C) 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013\r\n  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n  \r\n  Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,\r\n  are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright\r\n  notice and this notice are preserved.\r\n\r\nREADME:\r\n\r\nThis is GNU Awk 4.1.0. It is upwardly compatible with Brian Kernighan's\r\nversion of Unix awk.  It is almost completely compliant with the\r\n2008 POSIX 1003.1 standard for awk. (See the note below about POSIX.)\r\n\r\nThis is a major new release. See NEWS and ChangeLog for details.\r\n\r\nWork to be done is described briefly in the TODO file.  Changes in this\r\nversion are summarized in the NEWS file.\r\n\r\nRead the file POSIX.STD for a discussion of issues where the standard\r\nsays one thing but gawk does something different.\r\n\r\nTo format the documentation with TeX, use at least version 2013-03-19.11\r\nof texinfo.tex. There is a usable copy of texinfo.tex in the doc directory.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nCheck whether there is a system-specific README file for your system under\r\nthe `README_d' directory.  If there's something there that you should\r\nhave read and didn't, and you bug me about it, I'm going to yell at you.\r\n\r\nSee the file INSTALL for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nIf you have neither bison nor yacc, use the awkgram.c file here.  It was\r\ngenerated with bison, and has no proprietary code in it.  (Note that\r\nmodifying awkgram.y without bison or yacc will be difficult, at best.\r\nYou might want to get a copy of bison from the FSF too.)\r\n\r\nIf you have an MS-DOS, MS-Windows, or OS/2 system, use the stuff in the `pc'\r\ndirectory.  Similarly, there is a separate directory for VMS.\r\n\r\nAppendix B of ``GAWK: Effective Awk Programming'' discusses configuration\r\nin detail. The configuration process is based on GNU Autoconf and\r\nAutomake.\r\n\r\nAfter successful compilation, do `make check' to run the test suite.\r\nThere should be no output from the `cmp' invocations except in the\r\ncases where there are small differences in floating point values, and\r\npossibly in the case of strftime. Several of the tests ignore errors\r\non purpose; those are not a problem.  If there are other differences,\r\nplease investigate and report the problem.\r\n\r\nPRINTING THE MANUAL\r\n\r\nThe `doc' directory contains a recent version of texinfo.tex, which will\r\nbe necessary for printing the manual.  Use `make dvi' to get a DVI file\r\nfrom the manual. In the `doc' directory, use `make postscript' to get\r\nPostScript versions of the manual, the man page, and the reference card.\r\nUse `make pdf' to get PDF versions of the manuals, the man page and\r\nthe reference card.\r\n\r\nBUG REPORTS AND FIXES (Un*x systems):\r\n\r\nPlease coordinate changes through Arnold Robbins. In particular, see\r\nthe section in the manual on reporting bugs. Note that comp.lang.awk\r\nis about the worst place to post a gawk bug report. Please, use the\r\nmechanisms outlined in the manual.\r\n\r\nEmail should be sent to bug-gawk@gnu.org.  This is now a separate mailing\r\nlist at GNU Central.  The advantage to using this address is that bug\r\nreports are archived at GNU Central.\r\n\r\nArnold Robbins\r\n\r\nBUG REPORTS AND FIXES, non-Unix systems:\r\n\r\nMS-DOS with DJGPP:\r\n\tScott Deifik\r\n\tscottd.mail@sbcglobal.net\r\n\r\nMS-Windows with MinGW:\r\n\tEli Zaretskii\r\n\teliz@gnu.org\r\n\r\nOS/2:\r\n\tAndreas Buening\r\n\tandreas.buening@nexgo.de\r\n\r\nVMS:\r\n\tPat Rankin\r\n\tr.pat.rankin@gmail.com\r\n\r\nz/OS (OS/390):\r\n\tDave Pitts\r\n\tdpitts@cozx.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
